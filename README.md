#### Lever Press Tasks

On Lever Training: Start with levertrain, and move quickly to levertrainhold once the subject grasps the concept of pressing the lever. 

**levertrain**: Lever Training
Trains a subject to associate leverpresses with a target on-screen.

**levertrainhold**: Hold lever and release upon cue.

**lp**: Lever Press Task
Subject releases a lever when a target changes, keeps the lever pressed when it does not.

**lp_colorswitch**: Two-color Lever Press Task

**lp_dstrctr**: Lever Press Distractor Task
Presents a cued lever-press target at one of four locations and a distractor opposite.

**lp_dstrctr_choice**: Presents a cued lever-press target at one of four locations and a distractor opposite.
lp_dstrctr_choice shows cued green or cued blue targets in blocks.
